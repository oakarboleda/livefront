This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Storybook

## Playwright

## Requirements

- [ ] One screen list of items from that API
- [ ] Second screen should show a detail view
- [ ] Tests are required
- [ ] Minimally, make sure the app functions smoothly on Chrome, Firefox and at least one mobile
      browser.
- [ ] 3rd party libraries for common tasks (networking, etc.)
- [ ] The app must be able to be pulled down from this repo and built without any additional
      configuration. For example, Livefront should not be responsible for getting its own API keys
      or access. If an API key and/or username/password is required you can send that to us
      separately (it does not need to be stored in the repository)

## Bonus Points

best practices, is tested doesn't have errors, is commented appropriately (e.g. comment your public
interfaces), considers edge cases creativity and love of software
